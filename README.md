**Automatic System for Driver Drowsiness Detection Using Deep Learning**

**Overview**

This project is focused on developing a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system is designed to monitor a driver's eye movements and facial expressions to detect signs of drowsiness, helping to prevent potential accidents by triggering timely alerts.

**Features**

- **Real-Time Detection:** The system processes live video feeds to analyze driver behavior in real-time.
- **CNN-Based Model:** Utilizes CNNs for accurate image processing and feature extraction.
- **Alert System:** Issues warnings when signs of drowsiness are detected, enhancing driver safety.
- **Scalable and Efficient:** Designed to run efficiently on various hardware setups, including low-power devices.

 **Technologies Used**

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Deep Learning Framework:** TensorFlow/Keras
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas
- **Deployment:** Flask (for web-based interface), Docker (optional for containerization)
- **Version Control:** Git

**Installation**

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Driver-Drowsiness-Detection.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
    ```
3. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

 **Usage**

1. **Run the application:** Start the system by running the `main.py` file.
2. **Provide input:** The system uses a webcam or external camera feed to monitor the driver.
3. **Monitor output:** The system will display the video feed with real-time drowsiness detection.
4. **Receive alerts:** If drowsiness is detected, the system will issue an alert.

**Dataset**

- The model was trained on a custom dataset containing images of drivers in various states of alertness and drowsiness.
- The dataset is not included in this repository due to size constraints. However, you can find the data preprocessing scripts and instructions on how to prepare your dataset in the `data` directory.

**Results**

- The model achieved high accuracy in detecting drowsiness in real-time, with a low rate of false positives.
- Detailed performance metrics and visualizations are available in the `results` directory.
