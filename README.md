# Automatic-System-For-Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System-Using-Deep-Learning
This project involves the development of a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing. The system monitors driver eye movements and facial expressions to detect signs of drowsiness, triggering alerts to prevent potential accidents.
